## Headless UI Vue: Disabled Option in focus after click + arrow navigation

This is a minimal Vite + Vue 3 setup. To get setup:

```
yarn && yarn dev
```

To reproduce the issue, open the ListboxOptions, click on the disabled option (Simon) and then navigate up or down with the arrow keys.

The disabled option should now be in focus.
